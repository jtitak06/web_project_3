This is a project about traveling across the US. This is a responsive layout built for both mobile and desktop.

**My Process**

This was the first project I engaged in with the introduction of a responsive layout. Many @media queries were used to accommodate the different screen layouts. There were also multiple grids and flexboxes that were used at certain sections. 

The grids were used primarily to determine a specific layout for some sections. The flexboxes were used in @media queries to determine the layout of some of the text components. Additionally, flexbox was also used to determine the direction of the grid in the place section and to properly align the text within the place section as well.

Whenever I would run into an issue, I would use an online search to find the answer. If an online search could not provide the answers needed, I would ask the tutors in the Practicum Slack channel.

Everything that was learned and utilized while building this website will be utilized in future projects. This is all in accordance with my goal of growing my skills as a developer.
